\chap Conclusion

TBD

It is suitable to notice, that in many cases the intentions and activities of
semantic web community focus on government data~\cite[opengovernmentdata].
The common goal leads us to turn the web into an open, accessible source of
knowledge and data of all kinds, linking the data together where possible.
Naturally the governmental data and statistics get the most attention.
Government handles, collects and is ofthen obliged to publish in some form a
lot of data and statistics. Not always this form complies with standards of
semantic web. Sometimes it might even be the case of intentional presenting of
malformed data or obfuscation. In the big picture, misinformation of people
seems to be the major thread to democracy as we usually envision it. By
supporting the creation of semantic data we are naturally taking part in this
movement. The hope is to bring government data closer to people to help
overcome the information gap that prevents each one of us from being adequately
informed about how our resources are being spent an how our countries are truly
led and offices driven. I hope this and any follow-up work will serve to
support this common vision.
